# Spring Boot Application

This is a basic Spring Boot application that serves as a starting point for building Java applications using the Spring framework.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

```
spring-boot-app
├── src
│   ├── main
│   │   ├── java
│   │   │   └── com
│   │   │       └── example
│   │   │           └── Application.java
│   │   └── resources
│   │       └── application.properties
│   └── test
│       └── java
│           └── com
│               └── example
│                   └── ApplicationTests.java
├── pom.xml
└── README.md
```

## Prerequisites

- Java 11 or higher
- Maven

## Building the Application

To build the application, navigate to the project directory and run:

```
mvn clean install
```

## Running the Application

To run the application, use the following command:

```
mvn spring-boot:run
```

The application will start on the default port 8080. You can access it at `http://localhost:8080`.

## Running Tests

To run the tests, execute:

```
mvn test
```

## Configuration

You can configure the application settings in the `src/main/resources/application.properties` file. This file can be used to set various application properties such as server port, database configurations, and logging levels.
